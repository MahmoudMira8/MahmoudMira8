## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- Project 1: [Examination website](https://www.falla.fun/)
  - Description: Our website project, built using Angular and Node.js, revolutionizes the examination process for both teachers and students. Teachers can register using their email, log in, and create interactive exams. Upon exam creation, a unique code is generated, allowing students to enter and participate in the live examination session.

This interactive examination format ensures that students can only progress to the next question when the teacher advances to the next one. The teacher maintains control over the pacing of the exam, providing a seamless and synchronized experience for all participants.

After each question, the system displays the top 10 performers, keeping everyone informed about their standing. Upon completion of the exam, a fun and engaging display reveals the top three students, adding an element of excitement to the learning process.

Our platform not only simplifies the examination process but also enhances the overall experience for both teachers and students, fostering an interactive and dynamic educational environment..

- Project 2: [Omnifood](https://omnifood-healthyfood.netlify.app/)
